### Examples
- First cell **creates and lets you download** two sample inputs.
- The Gradio UI also shows **static download links** for the same examples.

### Notes
- Keep the repo **public** (simplest). For private repos, invite users with **read** access.
- Dependencies install from your GitHub-hosted `requirements.txt`.
- To depend on a library **directly from GitHub**, add a line like:
  `somepkg @ git+https://github.com/your-org/your-lib.git@v0.2.1`
